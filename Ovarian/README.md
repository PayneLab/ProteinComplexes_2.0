<h1>Analysis of protein complexes in ovarian cancer</h1>

<h3>Ratio_Analysis.ipynb</h3> Broad analysis of differences in mean ratios and variance for all protein complexes. Includes
some work on searching for mutations in proteins within each complex and/or mutations in proteins involved in transcriptional
regulation.

<h3>Interesting_Complexes.ipynb</h3> Brief explanations of how various complexes might be involved in ovarian cancer,
including references to publications, plots, and summaries of what our analyses revealed.

<h3>Clean_Dataset.ipynb</h3> The code used to clean up the original dataset to prepare it for analysis, including selecting
the correct rows/columns, splitting up combined rows, and querying Uniprot to map Uniprot IDs to gene names.
